# 4403movieSPAproj
In this default project, you will apply all knowledge and skills you developed through the individual
project and develop a single page application similar to the individual project. The knowledge and
skills are essentially jQuery, JSON, RESTful Web API, AJAX, and SPA UI design.
Students may form a team up to two people to complete the term project.
Core requirements of the application for all teams:
 The whole application is a single page application.
 Use the API provided by the Movie Database. You can find more information and study the
API here:

 Search/discover movies/TV shows by different methods. Provide at least two
search/discovery methods.
 Display search results in multiple views, with additional data presentation functions like
sorting, paging, filtering, etc.
 Display detailed movie data for one chosen movie/TV, including basic info, cast, reviews,
etc. Show details about a person (actor/actress) when a user request more information about
the cast.
 Display top/popular movies or TV shows.

 Other ways to extend or enhance the UI and search functionalities that offered by the movie

remove movies), through the single page UI.
 Use the movies API for authentication and manage favorites/watch list.
